## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an account to use 0xmeta.ai?">
    **No!** The facilitator is permissionless. No signup, no API keys, no registration.
    
    Just:
    1. Approve facilitator for USDC spending (one-time)
    2. Integrate x402 middleware
    3. Start accepting payments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is x402?">
    x402 is a protocol for HTTP-based payments. It's like a "402 Payment Required" status code, but with built-in payment authorization using blockchain signatures.
    
    **Key principle:** Customers pay merchants directly (no intermediaries).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What networks are supported?">
    Currently:
    - **Base Mainnet** (Chain ID: 8453)
    - **Base Sepolia** (Chain ID: 84532, testnet)
    
    More networks coming soon.

## Merchant Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I need to approve the facilitator?">
    **Technical reason:** The facilitator collects a $0.01 fee per settlement from your USDC balance using the standard ERC-20 `transferFrom` pattern.
    
    **How it works:**
    ```solidity
    // You approve facilitator (one-time)
    USDC.approve(treasury, 100 * 10^6); // 100 USDC
    
    // Later, facilitator collects fee per settlement
    USDC.transferFrom(merchant, treasury, 0.01 * 10^6); // $0.01
    ```
    
    **Why this pattern:**
    - x402 requires customers pay merchants directly (trust-minimization)
    - Facilitator can't split customer payments
    - Solution: Merchant pays fee separately via approval
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I approve the facilitator?">
    Use our provided script:
    
    ```bash
    # Configure
    export EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
    export NETWORK=mainnet  # or sepolia
    
    # Run approval
    node approve-facilitator.mjs
    ```
    
    This approves the facilitator treasury to spend USDC on your behalf.
    
    See [x402 Integration Guide](/x402-integration#merchant-approval-setup) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much should I approve?">
    **Recommended:** 100-1000 USDC
    
    **Calculation:** `Approval = Settlements × $0.01`
    
    Examples:
    - 100 USDC = 10,000 settlements
    - 500 USDC = 50,000 settlements
    - 1000 USDC = 100,000 settlements
    
    **Avoid:** Infinite approval (max uint256) for security reasons.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I revoke approval?">
    **Yes!** At any time:
    
    ```bash
    # Set approval to 0
    APPROVAL_AMOUNT=0 node approve-facilitator.mjs
    ```
    
    **Effect:** All future settlements will fail with `insufficient_allowance` error. Customers won't be charged.
    
    To resume: Re-run approval with desired amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check my remaining allowance?">
    Use our monitoring script:
    
    ```bash
    node check-allowance.mjs
    
    # Output:
    # 📍 Base Mainnet
    #    USDC Balance: 500.00 USDC
    #    Fee Allowance: 95.50 USDC
    #    Settlements: 9,550
    #    ✅ Good
    ```
    
    Set up automated monitoring via cron or alerts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Trust & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know the facilitator won't steal customer funds?">
    **It's cryptographically impossible.**
    
    **Why:**
    1. Customers authorize payments directly to **your address** (not facilitator)
    2. EIP-3009 signatures are cryptographically bound to recipient
    3. Facilitator has zero access to customer authorizations
    4. Facilitator cannot redirect customer funds
    
    **Technical details:**
    ```javascript
    // Customer signs authorization
    const authorization = {
      from: customerAddress,
      to: YOUR_MERCHANT_ADDRESS,  // ← Cryptographically bound
      value: "20000",
      signature: "0x..."
    };
    
    // Facilitator can only execute this EXACT transfer
    // Cannot change recipient or amount
    ```
    
    This is the core principle of x402: **trust-minimization**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the facilitator drain my USDC balance?">
    **No.** Only the approved amount is accessible.
    
    **Example:**
    - You approve: 100 USDC
    - Maximum risk: 100 USDC
    - Your remaining USDC: Safe
    
    **Best practice:** Approve reasonable amounts (100-1000 USDC), not infinite.
    
    **Monitoring:** Use `check-allowance.mjs` to track remaining approval.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the facilitator is hacked?">
    **Worst case:** Attacker drains your approved amount only.
    
    **Protection:**
    1. **Limit approval:** Don't approve more than you're willing to risk
    2. **Monitor regularly:** Check allowance frequently
    3. **Revoke if suspicious:** Set approval to 0 immediately
    
    **Your customer funds:** Always safe (facilitator has no access).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this more secure than traditional payment processors?">
    **Yes, in several ways:**
    
    **Traditional (Stripe, PayPal):**
    - ❌ Custody of customer funds
    - ❌ Can freeze/hold payments
    - ❌ Opaque settlement process
    
    **0xmeta (x402):**
    - ✅ No custody (direct to merchant)
    - ✅ Cannot freeze payments
    - ✅ On-chain auditable
    - ✅ Cryptographic guarantees
    
    **Trade-off:** Requires blockchain familiarity and USDC approval.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fees & Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are fees collected?">
    **Post-settlement via transferFrom:**
    
    **Flow:**
    1. Customer authorizes $0.02 to your address
    2. You receive 100% of customer payment ($0.02)
    3. Facilitator collects $0.01 fee from your approved USDC balance
    
    **Technical:**
    ```solidity
    // Step 1: Customer → Merchant (direct)
    transferWithAuthorization(customer, merchant, 20000); // $0.02
    
    // Step 2: Facilitator collects fee from merchant
    transferFrom(merchant, treasury, 10000); // $0.01
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the merchant pay the fee, not the customer?">
    **Technical constraint:** x402 requires customer payments go directly to merchants (trust-minimization). EIP-3009 signatures are cryptographically bound to exact recipient and amount. Cannot split customer payment.
    
    **Solution:** Merchant pays facilitator fee separately via standard ERC-20 approval.
    
    **Merchant pricing:** Add fee to your prices:
    - Your price: $0.01
    - Facilitator fee: $0.01
    - Customer pays: $0.02
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if settlement fails after fee collection?">
    **You paid $0.01 for the settlement attempt.**
    
    **Why:** Prevents free service exploitation. If facilitator provided verification/settlement attempt without charging, merchants could intentionally cause failures for free service.
    
    **Mitigation:** Test on Base Sepolia first, monitor settlement success rates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any hidden fees?">
    **No.**
    
    **What you pay:**
    - $0.01 USDC per successful settlement
    
    **What you DON'T pay:**
    - ❌ Monthly fees
    - ❌ Setup fees
    - ❌ Gas fees (facilitator pays)
    - ❌ Withdrawal fees
    - ❌ Percentage fees
    - ❌ Minimum volume requirements
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I revoke approval mid-settlement?">
    **Settlement fails gracefully.**
    
    **Flow:**
    1. Customer submits payment authorization
    2. Facilitator attempts fee collection
    3. Fee collection fails (approval revoked)
    4. Settlement blocked
    5. Customer NOT charged
    
    **Error response:**
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "insufficient_allowance",
        "message": "Merchant must approve facilitator"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use a different token besides USDC?">
    **Not yet.** Currently only USDC is supported.
    
    **Roadmap:** Multi-token support planned (USDT, DAI, etc.)
    
    **Why USDC first:** Most stable, widely adopted, best EIP-3009 support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test on testnet?">
    **Use Base Sepolia:**
    
    ```bash
    # 1. Get testnet USDC (Circle faucet)
    # 2. Approve facilitator on testnet
    NETWORK=sepolia node approve-facilitator.mjs
    
    # 3. Configure server for testnet
    # network: "eip155:84532" (v2) or "base-sepolia" (v1)
    
    # 4. Test payments
    ```
    
    **Testnet addresses:**
    - USDC: `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`
    - Treasury: `0x5D791e3554D0e83f171126905Bda1640Bf6f9A8B`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between x402 v1 and v2?">
    **Network format:**
    - **v1:** `"base-sepolia"` (string)
    - **v2:** `"eip155:84532"` (CAIP-2 format)
    
    **Both supported!** Use v2 for new integrations.
    
    **Migration:** See [x402 Integration Guide](/x402-integration#migration-v1-v2)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do settlements take?">
    **Typical timing:**
    - Verification: < 2 seconds
    - Fee collection: 5-10 seconds (on-chain tx)
    - Settlement execution: 30-60 seconds (via 1Shot)
    
    **Total:** 35-70 seconds average
    
    **Factors:**
    - Network congestion
    - RPC provider latency
    - 1Shot API processing time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see all transactions on-chain?">
    **Yes!** All transactions are public.
    
    **Fee collection:**
    ```
    https://basescan.org/tx/{fee_tx_hash}
    ```
    
    **Settlement:**
    ```
    https://basescan.org/tx/{settlement_tx_hash}
    ```
    
    **Merchant address activity:**
    ```
    https://basescan.org/address/{your_merchant_address}
    ```
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: insufficient_allowance">
    **Cause:** You haven't approved facilitator, or approval is depleted.
    
    **Solution:**
    ```bash
    # Check current allowance
    node check-allowance.mjs
    
    # If low/zero, approve more
    node approve-facilitator.mjs
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: fee_collection_failed">
    **Cause:** Your USDC balance is insufficient.
    
    **Solution:** Add USDC to your merchant address.
    
    **Check balance:**
    ```bash
    node check-allowance.mjs
    # Shows: USDC Balance: 0.00 USDC ← Problem
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Settlement taking too long">
    **Normal:** 35-70 seconds
    
    **If longer:**
    1. Check Base network status
    2. Verify 1Shot API status
    3. Check settlement status via API
    
    **Polling:**
    ```javascript
    const status = await checkSettlement(settlement_id);
    // status: "pending" | "settled" | "failed"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get support?">
    **Options:**
