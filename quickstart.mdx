## 🚀 Start Building Immediately

0xmeta.ai requires **zero setup**. No account creation, no API keys, no configuration files.

Just start making requests to accept x402 payments on Base network!

<Note>
  **Truly permissionless**: You can verify and settle payments without any
  authentication. Just call our API endpoints.
</Note>

---

## Step 1: Verify a Payment

When a customer makes a payment, verify it on-chain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_hash": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
    "chain": "base",
    "seller_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "expected_amount": "1000000",
    "expected_token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
  }'
```

<Tip>
  The `expected_token` is USDC on Base:
  `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
</Tip>

### Response

```json
{
  "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
  "status": "verified",
  "transaction_hash": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
  "chain": "base",
  "verified_amount": "1000000",
  "verified_token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
  "seller_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
  "verified_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

<Check>**Verification is FREE** - no fees charged for verifying payments</Check>

---

## Step 2: Settle the Payment

Use the `verification_id` to settle and receive funds:

```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
    "destination_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "payment_payload": {
      "from": "0xCustomerAddress",
      "validBefore": 1735689600,
      "validAfter": 0,
      "nonce": "0x...",
      "v": 28,
      "r": "0x...",
      "s": "0x..."
    }
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "settlement_id": "stl_def456uvw",
  "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
  "status": "pending",
  "transaction_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
  "destination_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
  "fee_info": {
    "fee_amount_usd": 7.5,
    "fee_percentage": 0.75,
    "net_amount_usd": 992.5,
    "rate": 0.75,
    "settlement_method": "smart_contract",
    "contract_address": "0xSettlementSplitterAddress"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:31:00Z"
}
```

<Info>
  **Settlement Fee**: 0.75% (minimum $1) is automatically deducted by our smart
  contract. You receive the net amount directly to your wallet.
</Info>

---

## Step 3: Check Settlement Status

Monitor settlement progress:

```bash
curl https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/settlements/stl_def456uvw
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "stl_def456uvw",
  "type": "settlement",
  "status": "settled",
  "transaction_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:31:00Z",
  "settled_at": "2025-01-15T10:32:15Z",
  "details": {
    "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
    "destination_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "settled_amount": "1000000",
    "fee_amount_usd": 7.5,
    "net_amount_usd": 992.5,
    "fee_collection_status": "collected"
  }
}
```

<Check>Settlements typically complete in **1-5 minutes** on Base network</Check>

---

## Optional: Set Up Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications when settlements complete:

```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_hash": "0x...",
    "chain": "base",
    "seller_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "expected_amount": "1000000",
    "webhook_url": "https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/settlement"
  }'
```

### Webhook Payload

When settlement completes, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "event": "settlement.completed",
  "settlement_id": "stl_def456uvw",
  "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
  "transaction_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
  "status": "settled",
  "amount": 1000000,
  "currency": "USDC",
  "fee_info": {
    "fee_amount_usd": 7.5,
    "net_amount_usd": 992.5,
    "rate": 0.75
  },
  "destination_address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
  "settled_at": "2025-01-15T10:32:15Z"
}
```

<Warning>
  Verify webhook signatures using our HMAC validation to ensure authenticity.
  See [Webhook Security](/guides/webhooks-setup)

## Understanding the Flow

Here's what happens when you use 0xmeta.ai:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Authorizes Payment">
    Customer signs an EIP-3009 authorization on the client side. This
    authorization is directed to our **SettlementSplitter smart contract** (not
    directly to you).
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Verify the Payment">
    Call `/v1/verify` to confirm the transaction is valid and the authorization
    is properly signed. This is **free** and instant.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Initiate Settlement">
    Call `/v1/settle` with the EIP-3009 signature. Our backend communicates with
    the 1Shot API to execute the smart contract.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Contract Splits Funds">
    The SettlementSplitter contract: 1. Receives the full payment from the
    customer 2. Calculates 0.75% fee (minimum $1) 3. Sends fee to 0xmeta
    treasury 4. Sends remaining 99.25% to your address. All in **one atomic
    transaction**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="You Receive Funds">
    Your wallet receives the net amount (after fees) in 1-5 minutes. Check
    BaseScan to see both transfers on-chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## No Authentication Required

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="No Signup" icon="user-slash">
    Start using the API immediately without creating an account
  </Card>

  <Card title="No API Keys" icon="key-slash">
    All endpoints are publicly accessible - no authentication needed
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Rate Limits" icon="infinity">
    Use as much as you need without quotas or throttling
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Lock-In" icon="unlock">
    No accounts means no platform lock-in or restrictions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Why no authentication?** We believe payment facilitation should be as
  permissionless as the blockchain itself. Anyone should be able to accept
  payments without barriers.
</Note>

## Fee Estimation

Want to know fees before settling? Use our estimation endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/pricing/estimate?amount=1000&chain=base"
```

### Response

```json
{
  "amount_usd": 1000.0,
  "fee_amount_usd": 7.5,
  "fee_percentage": 0.75,
  "net_amount_usd": 992.5,
  "minimum_fee_applied": false,
  "chain": "base"
}
```

---

## Idempotency

Prevent duplicate settlements by using idempotency keys:

```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Idempotency-Key: unique-key-12345" \
  -d '{
    "verification_id": "vrf_abc123xyz",
    "destination_address": "0xYourWalletAddress"
  }'
```

If you retry the same request with the same idempotency key, you'll receive the original response instead of creating a duplicate settlement.

<Tip>Use UUIDs or transaction hashes as idempotency keys</Tip>

## Example: Complete Integration

Here's a complete TypeScript example:

```typescript
// 1. Verify payment
const verifyResponse = await fetch(
  "https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/verify",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      transaction_hash: "0x...",
      chain: "base",
      seller_address: "0xYourAddress",
      expected_amount: "1000000", // 1 USDC
      expected_token: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    }),
  }
);

const { verification_id } = await verifyResponse.json();

// 2. Settle payment
const settleResponse = await fetch(
  "https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "X-Idempotency-Key": `settlement-${Date.now()}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      verification_id,
      destination_address: "0xYourAddress",
      payment_payload: {
        from: customerAddress,
        validBefore: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600,
        validAfter: 0,
        nonce: "0x...",
        v,
        r,
        s, // From customer's EIP-3009 signature
      },
    }),
  }
);

const settlement = await settleResponse.json();

// 3. Check status
const statusResponse = await fetch(
  `https://facilitator.api.0xmeta.ai/v1/settlements/${settlement.settlement_id}`
);

const status = await statusResponse.json();
console.log("Settlement status:", status.status);
console.log("You receive:", status.details.net_amount_usd);
```
