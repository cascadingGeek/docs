## How Fee Collection Works

Unlike traditional payment processors, 0xmeta.ai uses a **smart contract** to automatically split fees on-chain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Signs Authorization">
    Customer signs an EIP-3009 authorization to our SettlementSplitter smart
    contract (not directly to you).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settlement Initiated">
    You call `/v1/settle` to initiate the settlement process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Executes">
    The smart contract: 1. Receives the full payment amount 2. Automatically
    calculates 0.75% fee 3. Sends 0.75% to 0xmeta treasury 4. Sends remaining
    99.25% to your address. All in a **single atomic transaction**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You Receive Funds">
    Your wallet receives the net amount (after fees) in 1-5 minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Why Smart Contracts?** - **Trustless**: No need to trust us - the split is
  enforced on-chain - **Atomic**: Either all transfers succeed or all fail -
  **Transparent**: Every fee is visible on BaseScan - **Secure**: Battle-tested
  OpenZeppelin contracts
</Info>

## Fee Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Transaction

```
Payment Amount: $1,000 USDC
Settlement Fee: $1,000 × 0.75% = $7.50
You Receive: $992.50 USDC

Total Cost: $7.50 (0.75%)
```

### Example 2: Small Transaction

```
Payment Amount: $50 DAI
Settlement Fee: $50 × 0.75% = $0.375 → $1.00 (minimum)
You Receive: $49.00 DAI

Total Cost: $1.00 (2.0%)
```

### Example 3: Large Transaction

```
Payment Amount: $10,000 ETH
Settlement Fee: $10,000 × 0.75% = $75.00
You Receive: $9,925.00 ETH

Total Cost: $75.00 (0.75%)
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why 0.75% instead of 0.5%?">
    While 0.75% is slightly higher than our initial 0.5% target, it's still
    **74% cheaper than Stripe** and **25% cheaper than Coinbase Commerce**. This
    rate ensures sustainable operations while remaining the most competitive
    option in the market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I negotiate volume discounts?">
    Currently, we offer a flat 0.75% rate for all users. As our platform grows
    and we reach significant scale, we plan to introduce volume-based pricing
    tiers. For now, everyone gets the same competitive rate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are fees collected without API keys?">
    Fees are collected automatically through our smart contract. When a customer
    authorizes payment, they sign to our SettlementSplitter contract which
    automatically splits the funds on-chain. No authentication or manual
    intervention needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if the smart contract fails?">
    Our smart contract uses battle-tested OpenZeppelin libraries and includes
    comprehensive error handling. If any step fails, the entire transaction
    reverts - you either get the full settlement (minus fees) or nothing at all.
    No partial payments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I see all fees on-chain?">
    Absolutely! Every settlement and fee is recorded on the Base blockchain. You
    can view all transactions on BaseScan, including the exact split between
    your payment and our fee.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to approve anything?">
    No! Customers sign a standard EIP-3009 authorization which is built into
    USDC. No separate token approvals needed. One signature, one transaction,
    instant settlement.
  </Accordion>
