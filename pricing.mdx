## How Fee Collection Works

### Treasury-First Architecture

0xmeta collects fees **automatically** through treasury-first payment flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client[Client<br/>Pays $0.011] --> Treasury[0xmeta Treasury<br/>Receives $0.011]
    Treasury --> |Keeps Fee<br/>$0.01| Fee[Fee Collected]
    Treasury --> |Forwards<br/>$0.001| Merchant[Merchant<br/>Receives $0.001]
    
    style Treasury fill:#e1f5ff
    style Fee fill:#fff3cd
    style Merchant fill:#d4edda
```

**Flow:**
1. Client authorizes payment to **0xmeta treasury** ($0.011 total)
2. Treasury receives full amount
3. Treasury **keeps fee** ($0.01 USDC)
4. Treasury **forwards payment** to merchant ($0.001 USDC)

<Info>
**No merchant setup required!** Fee collection is automatic. Merchants receive payments with **zero gas costs**.
</Info>

## Fee Collection Process

### Technical Flow

```typescript
// 1. Client Authorization
const authorization = {
  from: clientAddress,
  to: treasuryAddress,      // 0xmeta treasury
  value: "11000",           // $0.011 (1000 wei merchant + 10000 wei fee)
  token: USDC_ADDRESS
};

// 2. Settlement Execution
// Step 1: Client → Treasury
await transferWithAuthorization({
  from: clientAddress,
  to: treasuryAddress,
  value: 11000  // Full amount
});
// Treasury balance: +11000 wei ($0.011)

// Step 2: Treasury → Merchant (automatic)
await transfer({
  from: treasuryAddress,
  to: merchantAddress,
  value: 1000  // Merchant portion
});
// Merchant balance: +1000 wei ($0.001)
// Treasury balance: +10000 wei ($0.01) - fee kept
```

### Settlement Response

```json
{
  "settlement_id": "stl_xyz",
  "status": "settled",
  "details": {
    "client_payment": "11000",        // What client paid
    "merchant_amount": "1000",        // What you received
    "facilitator_fee": "10000",       // 0xmeta fee
    "merchant_forward_tx": "0x...",   // Forwarding transaction
    "merchant_forwarded": true        // ✅ Payment delivered
  }
}
```

## Why This Pricing Model?

### Flat Fee Advantages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Predictable Costs">
    **Always $0.01 per settlement**, regardless of amount:
    - $0.10 transaction → $0.01 fee (10%)
    - $1.00 transaction → $0.01 fee (1%)
    - $10.00 transaction → $0.01 fee (0.1%)
    
    Perfect for **micropayments** where percentage fees don't make sense.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Hidden Fees">
    **What you see is what you pay:**
    - No monthly fees
    - No setup fees
    - No minimum volume
    - No percentage fees
    - No gas fees (paid by treasury)
    - No withdrawal fees
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Simple Math">
    **Easy to calculate:**
    ```
    Client pays = Your price + $0.01
    You receive = Your price
    0xmeta receives = $0.01
    ```
    
    No complex percentage calculations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Microtransaction Optimized">
    **Designed for small payments:**
    
    Traditional processors charge 2.9% + $0.30:
    - $0.10 item → $0.30 fee (300% markup!)
    - $1.00 item → $0.33 fee (33% markup)
    
    0xmeta charges $0.01:
    - $0.10 item → $0.01 fee (10% markup)
    - $1.00 item → $0.01 fee (1% markup)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Merchant Economics

### Calculate Your Net Revenue

```typescript
// Example: Weather API
const yourPrice = 0.001;      // $0.001 per request
const facilitatorFee = 0.01;  // $0.01 per settlement
const clientPays = 0.011;     // $0.011 total

// At 1000 requests/day:
const dailyRevenue = yourPrice * 1000;         // $1.00
const dailyFees = facilitatorFee * 1000;       // $10.00
const netRevenue = dailyRevenue - dailyFees;   // -$9.00 ❌

// You need ~10,000 req/day to be profitable with $0.001 pricing
```

<Warning>
**Important:** For very low-priced resources (<$0.01), you need significant volume to be profitable. Consider bundling or higher pricing.
</Warning>

## Billing & Payments

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="No Invoices">
    Fees are collected automatically during settlement. No invoices, no billing cycles.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Real-Time Collection">
    Fee is deducted from each settlement as it happens. No delayed billing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Transparent Tracking">
    Settlement responses show exact fee amounts:
    
    ```json
    {
      "facilitator_fee": "10000",  // $0.01 in wei
      "merchant_amount": "1000"    // What you received
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No Credit Risk">
    Since fees are collected upfront, there's no payment terms or credit risk.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Fee Transparency

### Settlement Breakdown

Every settlement response includes complete fee breakdown:

```json

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why $0.01 instead of percentage?">
    **Flat fees work better for micropayments:**
    - 2.9% of $0.10 = $0.003 (too low to be sustainable)
    - Plus fixed $0.30 = totally uneconomical
    
    $0.01 is the minimum viable fee for on-chain operations while keeping micropayments feasible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I negotiate lower fees?">
    **Yes, for high volume:**
    - 10K+ settlements/month: Custom pricing available
    - 100K+ settlements/month: Significant discounts
    - Enterprise contracts: Contact sales@0xmeta.ai
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any hidden fees?">
    **No:**
    - No monthly fees
    - No setup fees
    - No gas fees (treasury pays)
    - No withdrawal fees
    - Just $0.01 per successful settlement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if settlement fails?">
    **You pay $0.00:**
    - Verification is always free
    - Only successful settlements incur the $0.01 fee
    - Failed settlements cost nothing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I track my fees?">
    **Settlement responses include full breakdown:**
    ```json
    {
      "facilitator_fee": "10000",
      "merchant_amount": "1000"
    }
    ```
    
    You can also verify on-chain via block explorers.
