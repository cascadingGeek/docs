# Pricing

## Simple Flat-Rate Pricing

0xmeta.ai charges a **simple flat fee per settlement** based on your monthly volume. No percentages, no surprises.

```

## Flat Rate Model

We charge a **fixed amount per settlement**, not a percentage. Whether you settle $100 or $10,000, you pay the same flat fee based on your monthly volume tier.

<Info>
**Why flat rate?** Processing a settlement costs us the same whether it's $100 or $10,000. We charge based on our actual infrastructure costs, not transaction value.
</Info>

## Pricing Tiers

Tiers are calculated automatically based on your monthly settlement count. Lower rates unlock as your volume grows.

| Monthly Settlements | Flat Fee | Example Monthly Cost | Your Cost Basis |
|---------------------|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 0 - 100 | **$0.05** | $5 (100 × $0.05) | $0.05 per settlement |
| 101 - 500 | **$0.03** | $15 (500 × $0.03) | $0.03 per settlement |
| 501 - 2,500 | **$0.02** | $50 (2,500 × $0.02) | $0.02 per settlement |
| 2,501 - 10,000 | **$0.01** | $100 (10,000 × $0.01) | $0.01 per settlement |
| 10,001+ | **Custom** | Contact us | Enterprise pricing |

<Note>
Tiers update automatically each month based on your settlement count. No manual upgrades needed!

        0xmeta-->>Merchant: Error: Approve USDC spending
    end
```

## How It Works

### 1. Verification (FREE)
```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.0xmeta.ai/v1/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_hash": "0x...",
    "chain": "base",
    "seller_address": "0x...",
    "expected_amount": "1000000000",
    "expected_token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
  }'
```

**Cost: $0.00** - Verification is always free!

### 2. One-Time USDC Approval

Before your first settlement, approve 0xmeta to collect fees:

```javascript
// Approve USDC spending (one-time setup)
const USDC = "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"; // Base
const TREASURY = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb";

await usdcContract.approve(
  TREASURY,
  ethers.parseUnits("1000", 6) // Approve $1,000 worth of fees
);
```

<Warning>
**Important:** Merchants must approve USDC spending before settlements can be processed. This is a one-time setup step.
</Warning>

### 3. Settlement (Flat Fee)

```bash
curl -X POST https://facilitator.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verification_id": "vrf_abc123",
    "destination_address": "0x...",
    "amount": "1000000000"
  }'
```

**Cost:** Based on your tier (e.g., $0.02 for Tier 3)

The settlement flow:
1. We check your USDC allowance
2. We charge the flat fee via `transferFrom` 
3. We execute the settlement from customer to you
4. You receive the full customer payment amount

## Cost Examples

### Example 1: Small Business (Tier 1)
```
Monthly settlements: 50
Flat fee per settlement: $0.05
Average transaction: $1,000

Monthly cost: 50 × $0.05 = $2.50
Total volume: 50 × $1,000 = $50,000
Effective rate: $2.50 / $50,000 = 0.005%
```

### Example 2: Growing Company (Tier 3)
```
Monthly settlements: 1,000
Flat fee per settlement: $0.02
Average transaction: $5,000

Monthly cost: 1,000 × $0.02 = $20
Total volume: 1,000 × $5,000 = $5,000,000
Effective rate: $20 / $5,000,000 = 0.0004%
```

### Example 3: High-Volume (Tier 4)
```
Monthly settlements: 5,000
Flat fee per settlement: $0.01
Average transaction: $10,000

Monthly cost: 5,000 × $0.01 = $50
Total volume: 5,000 × $10,000 = $50,000,000
Effective rate: $50 / $50,000,000 = 0.0001%
```

## Fee Collection Method

### Smart Contract Pay-Per-Settlement

We use ERC-20 `transferFrom` to collect flat fees in USDC:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Merchant Approves">
    One-time approval of USDC spending to our treasury address.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement Requested">
    Merchant calls `/v1/settle` endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fee Collected">
    We execute `transferFrom` to collect the flat fee (e.g., $0.02).
    ```solidity
    USDC.transferFrom(merchant, treasury, flatFee);
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Settlement Executes">
    Customer's payment is settled to merchant's address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

All in real-time, no batching or delayed billing.

## Transparent Cost Structure

### Our Infrastructure Costs

We're transparent about our costs so you understand the value:

**Per settlement, our costs are:**
- 1Shot API operations: 3 reads + 1 write = **~$0.01**
  - Read operations: 3 × $0.0025 = $0.0075
  - Write operations: 1 × $0.0025 = $0.0025
- Database & hosting: **~$0.003**
- Smart contract gas: **~$0.002**
- **Total cost per settlement: ~$0.015**

Our pricing:
- Tier 1 ($0.05): 233% markup - covers customer acquisition
- Tier 2 ($0.03): 100% markup - sustainable margin
- Tier 3 ($0.02): 33% markup - volume efficiency
- Tier 4 ($0.01): Break-even - enterprise retention

<Check>
We're profitable at scale while keeping your costs predictable and fair.
</Check>

## Why Flat Rate Works Better

### 1. Your Costs Don't Scale With Transaction Value

```
Processing a $100 settlement:
- 1Shot API calls: $0.01
- Database writes: $0.003
- Total: $0.013

Processing a $10,000 settlement:
- 1Shot API calls: $0.01
- Database writes: $0.003
- Total: $0.013
```

Same infrastructure cost = same fee. That's fair.

### 2. Better for High-Value Transactions

**Example: $10,000 USDC settlement**

| Model | Fee | You Receive | Effective % |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Traditional 2.9% + $0.30 | $290.30 | $9,709.70 | 2.903% |
| Percentage 1% | $100.00 | $9,900.00 | 1.000% |
| **0xmeta Flat $0.02** | **$0.02** | **$9,999.98** | **0.0002%** |

You save $290.28 per transaction.

### 3. Predictable Budgeting

**Traditional percentage model:**
```
Month 1: $100K revenue → $2,900 fees
Month 2: $500K revenue → $14,500 fees ⬆️ 400%
Month 3: $1M revenue → $29,000 fees ⬆️ 900%
```

**0xmeta flat rate model:**
```
Month 1: 1,000 settlements → $20 fees
Month 2: 1,000 settlements → $20 fees ➡️ Same
Month 3: 1,000 settlements → $20 fees ➡️ Same
```

Your costs stay consistent as your business grows.

  "period_start": "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z"
}

### Tier Calculation Logic

```typescript
function calculateTier(monthlySettlements: number): Tier {
  if (monthlySettlements <= 100) return { tier: 1, fee: 0.05 };
  if (monthlySettlements <= 500) return { tier: 2, fee: 0.03 };
  if (monthlySettlements <= 2500) return { tier: 3, fee: 0.02 };
  if (monthlySettlements <= 10000) return { tier: 4, fee: 0.01 };
  return { tier: 5, fee: "contact_us" };
}
```

Tiers reset monthly and are calculated in real-time based on your usage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if my transaction is smaller than the fee?">
    Our flat fees are designed to be negligible even for small transactions:
    
    - Tier 1 ($0.05): Suitable for transactions $5+
    - Tier 4 ($0.01): Suitable for transactions $1+
    
    Most crypto transactions are well above these minimums. Contact us if you need to process micro-transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is my tier calculated?">
    Based on successful settlements in the current calendar month:
    
    - Count resets on the 1st of each month
    - Failed settlements don't count
    - Only successful settlements affect your tier
    
    Check anytime: `GET /v1/pricing/my-tier`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When is the flat fee charged?">
    **Before settlement execution:**
    
    1. You call `/v1/settle`
    2. We check your USDC allowance
    3. We collect the flat fee via `transferFrom`
    4. We execute the settlement
    
    If fee collection fails, settlement doesn't proceed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund if settlement fails?">
    Yes! If settlement fails after we've collected the fee, we automatically refund it within 24 hours.
    
    Track refund status: `GET /v1/settlements/{settlement_id}`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why flat rate instead of percentage?">
    **Our costs are fixed per settlement:**
    
    - API operations cost the same regardless of amount
    - Database writes cost the same
    - Smart contract gas costs the same
    
    Percentage fees make sense for credit cards (fraud, chargebacks). Crypto doesn't have these issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much USDC should I approve?">
    Approve enough for your expected monthly volume:
    
    ```
    Example (Tier 3, 1,000 settlements/month):
    1,000 × $0.02 = $20 per month
    
    Recommended approval: $50-$100
    (enough for 2-5 months of fees)
    ```
    
    Check allowance: `GET /v1/pricing/allowance`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any other fees?">
    **No other fees whatsoever:**
    
    - ✅ Verification: FREE
    - ✅ Status checks: FREE
    - ✅ Webhooks: FREE
    - ✅ API usage: FREE
    - ✅ Gas fees: Included
    - ✅ 1Shot operations: Included
    
    **Only charge:** Flat fee per successful settlement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I lock in a specific tier?">
    Enterprise customers (Tier 5) can lock in custom rates via annual contracts.
