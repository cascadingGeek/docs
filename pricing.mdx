POST https://facilitator.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle → $0.001 flat fee

## Flat Rate Model

We charge a **fixed $0.001 per settlement**, not a percentage. Whether you settle $100 or $10,000, you pay the same predictable fee.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Why flat rate?** Processing a settlement costs us the same whether it's $100
  or $10,000. We charge based on our actual infrastructure costs, not
  transaction value.

    Customer->>Blockchain: Send payment ($1,000 USDC)
    Merchant->>0xmeta: POST /verify (FREE)
    0xmeta->>Blockchain: Verify transaction
    0xmeta-->>Merchant: Verification confirmed

    Merchant->>0xmeta: POST /settle
    0xmeta->>Merchant: Check USDC allowance

    end

How It Works
1. Verification (FREE)

curl -X POST https://facilitator.0xmeta.ai/v1/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_hash": "0x...",
    "chain": "base",
    "seller_address": "0x...",
    "expected_amount": "1000000000",
    "expected_token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
  }'

  Cost: $0.00 - Verification is always free!

2. One-Time USDC Approval
Before your first settlement, approve 0xmeta to collect fees:
// Approve USDC spending (one-time setup)
const USDC = "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"; // Base
const TREASURY = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb";

await usdcContract.approve(
  TREASURY,
  ethers.parseUnits("1000", 6) // Approve $1,000 worth of fees
);

<Warning> **Important:** Merchants must approve USDC spending before settlements can be processed. This is a one-time setup step. </Warning>

3. Settlement (Flat Fee)

curl -X POST https://facilitator.0xmeta.ai/v1/settle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verification_id": "vrf_abc123",
    "destination_address": "0x...",
    "amount": "1000000000"
  }'

  Cost: $0.001 flat fee per settlement

The settlement flow:

1.  We check your USDC allowance

2.  We charge the flat fee via transferFrom

3.  We execute the settlement from customer to you

4.  You receive the full customer payment amount

Fee Collection Method
Smart Contract Pay-Per-Settlement
We use ERC-20 transferFrom to collect flat fees in USDC:

<Steps> <Step title="Merchant Approves"> One-time approval of USDC spending to our treasury address. </Step> <Step title="Settlement Requested"> Merchant calls `/v1/settle` endpoint. </Step> <Step title="Fee Collected"> We execute `transferFrom` to collect the flat fee ($0.001). ```solidity USDC.transferFrom(merchant, treasury, 1000); // $0.001 in USDC (6 decimals) ``` </Step> <Step title="Settlement Executes"> Customer's payment is settled to merchant's address. </Step> </Steps>
All in real-time, no batching or delayed billing.

Why Flat Rate Works Better
1. Your Costs Don't Scale With Transaction Value
Processing a $100 settlement:
- Infrastructure costs: Fixed
- API operations: Fixed
- Total: $0.001

Processing a $10,000 settlement:
- Infrastructure costs: Fixed
- API operations: Fixed
- Total: $0.001

Same infrastructure cost = same fee. That's fair.

2. Better for High-Value Transactions
Example: $10,000 USDC settlement

Model	Fee	You Receive	Effective %
Traditional 2.9% + $0.30	$290.30	$9,709.70	2.903%
Percentage 1%	$100.00	$9,900.00	1.000%
0xmeta Flat $0.001	$0.001	$9,999.999	0.00001%
You save $290.299 per transaction.

3. Predictable Budgeting
Traditional percentage model:
Month 1: $100K revenue → $2,900 fees
Month 2: $500K revenue → $14,500 fees ⬆️ 400%
Month 3: $1M revenue → $29,000 fees ⬆️ 900%

0xmeta flat rate model:
Month 1: 1,000 settlements → $1.00 fees
Month 2: 1,000 settlements → $1.00 fees ➡️ Same
Month 3: 1,000 settlements → $1.00 fees ➡️ Same

Your costs stay consistent as your business grows.

Frequently Asked Questions
<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="What if my transaction is smaller than the fee?"> Our flat fee is designed to be negligible even for small transactions:
- $0.001 fee is suitable for transactions $1+
- Most crypto transactions are well above this minimum

Contact us if you need to process micro-transactions below $1.

</Accordion> <Accordion title="When is the flat fee charged?"> **Before settlement execution:**

1. You call `/v1/settle`
2. We check your USDC allowance
3. We collect the flat fee via `transferFrom`
4. We execute the settlement

If fee collection fails, settlement doesn't proceed.

</Accordion> <Accordion title="Can I get a refund if settlement fails?"> Yes! If settlement fails after we've collected the fee, we automatically refund it within 24 hours.

Track refund status: `GET /v1/settlements/{settlement_id}`

</Accordion> <Accordion title="Why flat rate instead of percentage?"> **Our costs are fixed per settlement:**

- API operations cost the same regardless of amount
- Database writes cost the same
- Smart contract gas costs the same

Percentage fees make sense for credit cards (fraud, chargebacks). Crypto doesn't have these issues.

````

Example (1,000 settlements/month):
1,000 × $0.001 = $1.00 per month

Recommended approval: $5-$10
(enough for 5-10 months of fees)

````

</Accordion> <Accordion title="Are there any other fees?"> **No other fees whatsoever:**

- ✅ Verification: FREE
- ✅ Status checks: FREE
- ✅ Webhooks: FREE
- ✅ API usage: FREE
- ✅ Gas fees: Included

**Only charge:** $0.001 flat fee per successful settlement.
