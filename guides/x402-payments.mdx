## x402 Payment Protocol

Every API request to 0xmeta must include a valid **payment proof** header (`X-Payment-Proof`) generated via the x402 protocol.  
No API key is required.

### Steps to Use

1. Connect your wallet and sign the small transaction via x402.
2. Receive a payment proof token.
3. Include the token in your request header:
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Payment-Proof: YOUR_PAYMENT_PROOF" https://api.0xmeta.ai/v1/markets/trends
   ```
