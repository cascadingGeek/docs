## Caching Strategy

0xmeta uses a multi-layered caching strategy to deliver fast responses while maintaining freshness:

- **Edge Cache (CDN)**: Rarely more than 30 seconds stale.
- **Redis / In-memory cache (1 hour TTL)**: Popular endpoints stay warm.
- **Primary Database (24-hour retention)**: All raw data is retained for up to 24 hours.

### Integrator Tips

- For interactive dashboards, pull data at modest intervals (e.g., every 10–30 seconds).
- For analytics pipelines, schedule jobs to batch fetch endpoints and deduplicate.
- Respect cache invalidation: if you require ultra-fresh data, set `cache=false` (if supported) or call less-cached endpoints.
