## Error Responses

| Status | Meaning               | Recommended Action                        |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 200    | Success               | Process the response as usual.            |
| 402    | Payment Required      | Request a new payment proof via x402.     |
| 429    | Too Many Requests     | Back-off, retry later.                    |
| 500    | Internal Server Error | Retry after a delay, monitor status page. |
| 503    | Service Unavailable   | Typically maintenance; retry later.       |

### Example (Python)

```python
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
elif response.status_code == 402:
    raise Exception("Payment required – get new proof")
elif response.status_code == 429:
    sleep(60)
    retry()
else:
    raise Exception(f"Unexpected status code: {response.status_code}")
```
