## Rate Limits

To ensure stability for all our users, 0xmeta enforces the following rate limits:

| Scope     | Limit                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Free tier | 10 requests/minute                  |
| Paid tier | 60 requests/minute or as negotiated |

### Handling Rate Limit Responses

- If you receive HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`, back-off and retry after a short delay.
- For sustained usage, contact our sales team to increase your rate quota.
