## Data Architecture Overview

0xmeta fuses three intelligence layers:

1. **News Intelligence** – aggregated from curated media and crypto-industry sources.
2. **Social Intelligence** – derived from verified crypto-community discussions and social sentiment.
3. **On-Chain Intelligence** – monitoring token flows, TVL movements, protocol activity, and liquidity shifts.

All streams are processed by the 0xmeta indexing pipeline, normalized, scored, and exposed via our single unified API.
