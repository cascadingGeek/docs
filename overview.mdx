## What is 0xMeta

0xMeta is the **Facilitator Infrastructure Layer** that powers how developers build services on top of the **x402 protocol**.

It acts as the coordination fabric between **data**, **capital**, and **logic**, giving developers a programmable runtime to create high-level services, automations, and agents that leverage x402’s primitives.

Instead of writing complex glue code or managing multiple integrations, you define your logic once — and the 0xMeta facilitator handles orchestration, state, and execution behind the scenes.

:::info
**In short:**  
x402 provides the base protocol (accounts, liquidity, and data).  
0xMeta provides the facilitator runtime that makes those capabilities programmable.

## Why 0xMeta Exists

x402 exposes powerful protocol primitives — pools, accounts, data streams, and credit flows — but using them directly requires deep technical coordination.

0xMeta abstracts that complexity by introducing a **facilitator layer** that manages:

- Transaction routing and orchestration
- Data synchronization across systems
- Event-driven logic and trigger management
- State persistence, retries, and job recovery

Developers can focus on **what to build**, not **how to wire it together**.

## Our Approach

We take a **build-to-prove** approach.  
Instead of publishing abstract whitepapers or static documentation, we demonstrate 0xMeta’s capabilities through a series of **micro-protocols** and **facilitator-driven agents**.

Each micro-protocol serves as a _live reference implementation_ showing how our facilitator infrastructure can be extended to solve specific coordination problems inside x402.

These micro-protocols are designed to:

- Stress-test facilitator primitives in production-like conditions
- Expose best practices for developer integrations
- Showcase how small, composable protocols can interoperate through the 0xMeta runtime
- Accelerate learning by giving developers real patterns to copy, extend, or remix

By building these micro-protocols and agents, we shorten the feedback loop between infrastructure design and real-world usage.  
Developers learn by example, while the facilitator infrastructure continuously evolves through field testing.

**Examples include:**

- **Liquidity Routers:** small services that coordinate capital across x402 pools
- **Signal Agents:** facilitators that respond to data events and trigger flows
- **Credit Executors:** automations that manage risk or optimize position exposure

Each of these is a working proof of how 0xMeta operates under real network conditions — showing you _how to build with it_, not just _what it can do_.

## The Facilitator Model

A **facilitator** is the core runtime unit within 0xMeta.  
It listens to events from x402, triggers actions based on defined logic, and exposes clean APIs for your services to consume.

Each facilitator can:

- React to x402 events or external triggers
- Execute multi-step flows (data, AI, or capital)
- Maintain state and ensure deterministic outcomes
- Expose its own REST endpoints for external access

```bash
[x402 Protocol Layer]
(Accounts | Liquidity | Data Streams)
        ↓
  [0xMeta Facilitator Infrastructure]
 (Logic | Routing | State | Execution)
        ↓
   [Your Services / Agents]
```
